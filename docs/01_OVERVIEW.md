## Trench Transparency Terminal (TTT) --- Product Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Product Vision

Trench Transparency Terminal (TTT) is a public web application designed
to bring transparency, clarity, and actionable intelligence to Solana
token markets.

The goal is simple:

**Paste a token mint → understand the risk immediately.**

This tool translates complex on-chain activity into clear signals anyone
can understand --- traders, builders, analysts, or curious users.

This is not financial advice or a trading platform.\
It is an **intelligence and transparency layer for Solana.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem We Are Solving

### Current Reality (The Trenches)

-   Tokens launch constantly with little transparency
-   Deployer wallets are often unknown
-   Funding sources are hidden or unclear
-   Rug pulls and insider activity are difficult to detect quickly
-   Blockchain data is technically accessible but not user-friendly

Most users rely on:

-   rumors
-   social hype
-   incomplete data
-   screenshots and speculation

This creates avoidable risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Our Solution

TTT aggregates blockchain intelligence using Helius infrastructure and
presents it in a clean, accessible web interface.

We provide:

### 1. Deployer Intelligence

Identify likely deployer wallets and explain confidence level.

### 2. Funding Transparency

Detect whether wallets were funded by: - centralized exchanges -
bridges - mixers - unknown sources

### 3. Behavioral Signals

Analyze transaction patterns: - early transfers - potential cash-out
behavior - wallet freshness - suspicious clustering

### 4. Explainable Risk Score

A transparent score based on observable signals, always accompanied
by: - clear reasoning - uncertainty disclosures

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Target Users

### Primary

-   Meme coin traders ("trenches")
-   Alpha group researchers
-   Crypto analysts
-   Web3 community moderators

### Secondary

-   Journalists and investigators
-   Builders researching competitor tokens

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Journey

### Step 1 --- Discovery

User visits website homepage.

### Step 2 --- Input

User pastes: - token mint address - or wallet address (future feature)

### Step 3 --- Analysis

Backend: - resolves deployer - queries Helius Wallet API - analyzes
funding source and history - computes signals and risk score - generates
shareable report

### Step 4 --- Results

User sees: - verdict header - deployer panel - funding source - recent
transfers - explainable risk score - shareable report link

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Principles

### Transparency First

Always show: - confidence levels - evidence - unknown factors

### Explainability

No black-box scoring. Every signal must be understandable.

### Accessibility

Anyone should use it without technical knowledge.

### Neutrality

We present data, not hype or opinion.
